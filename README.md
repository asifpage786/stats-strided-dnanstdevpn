## 📈 Standard Deviation Calculation
The standard deviation of a set of numbers measures the amount of variation or dispersion of the values from the mean. In this repository, we are focused on calculating the standard deviation for a double-precision floating-point strided array, where NaN values are ignored using a two-pass algorithm.

## 🤖 Two-Pass Algorithm
The two-pass algorithm is an approach to calculate the standard deviation of a dataset in two consecutive passes. In the first pass, the algorithm computes the mean of the dataset, while in the second pass, it calculates the standard deviation using the mean obtained from the first pass. This method is efficient and helps in handling potentially missing or unexpected data values like NaN.

## 💡 How It Works
The implementation in this repository ensures a reliable and accurate calculation of the standard deviation for strided arrays in JavaScript. By utilizing the two-pass algorithm, NaN values are appropriately handled, allowing for a robust statistical analysis of the dataset.
